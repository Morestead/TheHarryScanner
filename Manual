**User Instructions**

- This script is a port scanner that can scan a single IP address or a range of IP addresses. It uses the socket library to create a socket object and connect to ports, and the tqdm library to provide a progress bar while scanning.

- The script also uses the ipinfo library to get details about an IP address, such as the city, region, country, latitude, longitude, postal code, and time zone. !!! (You will need to input your own ipinfo.io access token on line 36) !!!

- After scanning, the script writes the results to a CSV file with the format "Host, Port, Service, Banner"

- The script begins with importing necessary libraries and dependencies like pyfiglet, tqdm, socket, csv, ipinfo, ipaddress

- Next, the script defines the get_ip_details() function that takes an IP address as input, initializes an ipinfo client with an access token, and returns the details of the IP address.

- Then, the script defines the scan_ports() function that takes an IP address and a list of ports as input, and returns a list of open ports and a list of scan results. This function iterates over the ports and uses the socket library to create a socket object and connect to each port. If the port is open, it appends the port number to the open_ports list and collects the banner. Then, it appends the scan results to the results list.

- The script also defines the print_details() function that takes an IP address details dictionary as input and prints the relevant details.

- The scan_ip() function takes an IP address and a list of ports as input and scans the IP address for open ports using the scan_ports() function. It also gets the IP address details using the get_ip_details() function and prints them using the print_details() function.

- The write_csv() function takes the scan results and a filename as input and writes the results to a CSV file.

- Finally, the script prompts the user to enter an option to scan a single IP address or a range of IP addresses, and then prompts for the IP address or IP range to scan. It then scans the IP addresses and writes the results to a CSV file.
